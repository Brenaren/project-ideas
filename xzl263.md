# Project Idea
## Summary
*Goal*

  The goal of this project is to create an inventory system for businesses to use that will maintain their inventory, assist in ordering new product, and give useful metrics for the owner.

*The* *Problem*

  The problem that is being solved herre is mostly for small businesses. A lot of small business owners do not have lots of business experience or training and would benefit greatly from a program that could help them maintain stock and work out when to do sales on what products.

*Features*

-Inventory management   : The program would keep a database of currently stocked items.
-Restocking Suggestions : The program will help mainain necessary stock with a sales forcast aided restocking suggestion.
-Sales Tracking         : The program will track sales and use the tracking to forcast future sales.
-Sales Forecasting      : The program will use past sales compared with recent sales to forcast future sales.
-Stock Sale Suggestion  : A feature we would like to add if we are able is a way to suggest a sale based on recent sales compared to previous sales.

## Languages and Tools

We will be using C++ for the majority of the code involved in the prjoect. We will likely use QT as our graphical interface for our users. There is a chance we will use a web-based database tool, but we will start with storing and reading from files on a local system.

## Target Customers

Our target customers is business owners. Most large corporations already have tools they use, but that does not mean they wouldn't want a better tool if it were offered. Small business owners would also be a great target group as this program would help any without business knowledge in many ways.
